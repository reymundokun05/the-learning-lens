	    <p>Studying the different educational philosophies such as Essentialism, Progressivism, Perennialism, Existentialism, Behaviorism, Linguistic Philosophy and Constructivism has provided me with good insight on how I would like to teach.</p>
		<p>Teaching nurturing is a principle held in place by essentialism, which seeks to focus on the basics and beginning, I thought this was the most efficient way to prepare the learners for basic knowledge and skills. However, I also know that no matter how much content is good for students, the content also needs to be entertaining for learners and make them interested and curious. In my case, I want to combine cognitive inputs and creativity while being a teacher so that my students understand the material is necessary but fun too.</p>
			
		<p>Out of all the instructional ideologies, I simply embrace progressivism because of the emphasis on learner-centered education via use of critical thinking abilities. This I find how the approach helps the students to be ready to face real life situations.T Thinking about it more, I realize that Iâ€™d like to build a learning environment into which students will be eager to learn new things, make inquiries, and apply this knowledge to their own lives. It is my belief: This philosophy compels me to offer more engaging lessons instead of the ordinary approach we sometimes use in the classroom.</p>
			
		<p>Perennialism are based on eternal knowledge and classic works. While I acknowledge the validity of confronting students with these timeless ideas, at times I wonder how topical they could be in such rapidly changing times. As a teacher, I am going to need to reconcile tradition with modern thinking and find ways in which those timeless teachings could possibly make some difference in my students' lives.</p>
			
		<p>Existentialism emphasizes choice, thereby giving individual meaning to life. It made me change my consideration of importance by allowing students to voice their opinions when I make decisions in the classroom. According to students, it is important that they feel empowered and be able to explore their identities; however, as the teacher, I have to balance personal freedom with the need for structure in the classroom.</p>
			
		<p>Behaviorism is a type that focuses on observable behaviors and reinforcement. Although highly effective for classroom management, I am afraid that this approach may limit students' creativity and intrinsic motivation. I want to motivate my future students in ways that will make them curious and love learning instead of waiting for rewards or fear of punishment.</p>
			
		<p>Linguistic Philosophy made my eyes open to the power of language in education. When I speak in certain ways, it will influence how students understand and get involved with such ideas. Knowing that as a teacher, I have to pay attention to the language I employ in how it helps make my students learn through it. Clear communication makes students confident about what they think and say.</p>
			
		<p>Lastly, Constructivism encourages active learning where children find things out for themselves through experience. I find this approach very attractive because it emphasizes a type of personal discovery. Reflecting on this, I realize how crucial it is to establish such a setting in the classroom, one where students feel empowered to explore, make mistakes, and construct knowledge in a meaningful way.</p>
			
		<p>The philosophies of teaching and learning are more than the mere attempt at transferring knowledge. The philosophies create a learning environment, thus aiding in the progression of students in different ways. I look forward to taking the best from each philosophy in an attempt to form my own unique blend that leads me in the direction of what I want to do for my future students.</p>
