	    <p>A discussion about different teaching philosophies took place last Thursday. On those presentations by my various classmates, I have realized that a constructivism is the teaching philosophy that explains the active role of the learner to construct his or her knowledge and understanding of the world. Having listened to it, I got better understandings into its importance in education. That is, constructivism makes the shift from the source of knowledge being the teacher alone to the student as an active participant in his own learning process.</p>
		<p>The idea that learning is not a passive process has been one of the most important lessons for me: students are not merely receptive vessels of information but rather are active users who question, connect, and relate something to their own experience. This is the way they will internalize concepts and make them meaningful and truly understood. The function of the teacher in this perspective is that of a guide or facilitator, encouraging exploration and critical thought rather than merely transmitting facts.</p>
		<p>I also learned that constructivism is a basis of individualized learning; it recognizes the fact that every student, due to his or her background experience, brings something different into the classroom. Hence, teaching methods should be flexible and fashioned to suit different learners. Activities such as group discussions, hands-on activities, and many others provoke collaboration and greater interest in material.</p>
		<p>Overall, I think constructivism brings a much more meaningful and sustainable learning experience in the sense that it allows students to become far more responsible for their own learning while developing greater skills for critical thinking. And, for sure, I will not forget this as I continue further on along my journey as an Education student.</p>
