	  <div id="col1_info">
		<p>In the perspective of a teacher in the society, I can say that teaching is not just a profession; it is an occupation that is deeply embedded in the community. Teachers are those who encourage development, exemplify decorum, and extend help, and their impacts transcend the classroom. In this context, I wonder how much such professionals devote themselves to the betterment of the society as a whole—that is not only through education but also through their help, moral code, and stability. It is quite interesting to find out that so many people aspire to become teachers, who tend to influence the very formation of a community in a manner that is hardly evident. </p>
		<p>One thing that surprises me is the expectations against teachers by the society. They are entrusted to practice elements such as honesty, patience and compassion not only to their pupils but to the entirety of the adult society that venerates them. Teachers are expected to be paragons of virtue, therefore they take on quite deadly risk just by occupying space in daily life. This makes me think about how much those power. “Those in prestige, positively influence the thoughts of people inside the sphere. The society is sustained, and helps to adhere to rather moral beliefs that encourage the individual to be upright in dealings”</p>
		<p>Tutors also become patrons and leaders, assisting in ways that are more extensive than just providing instructional material. Many have had a teacher come to life in them so much that even they feel that the teacher encourages them, and such tend to be the most fulfilling relationships one can have tuman beings. It is often a teacher who calms them and helps them find their way when they are confused. Thinking of this situation, I understand that a teacher’s work is not only confined to instruction but also includes nurturing the individual’s growth and emotional health. </p>
		<p>Advocacy is yet another role that a teacher plays in the community. A teacher is usually aware where some people or rather groups of people are getting low or no services at all, whether as a result of lack of teaching materials, acceptance or even psychological support. Due to their communities’ affiliation with other people, teachers are often the ones who can relate other people to their needs. This makes me understand how transformative equity can be which in turn helps me to know the way teachers contribute to social justice within communities by advocating for change where everyone gets help.</p>
		<p>While contemplating this enlarged perspective of teacher’s position in the society, I also think that it is the position of power and at the same time low profile. Teachers are often perceived as authority figures or leader, but they tend to every ready to lend help and learn from others in their task. That’s motivating for me because it shows that leading does not always mean having power over others – it often means helping people and being willing to learn in the process.</p>
		<p>And finally, learning about the teacher as a social personality opened my eyes in how they are much more than instructors – they are guides, defenders and caring figures too. They always care for, encourage, and relate people in a manner that extends far beyond school work, and makes communities and lives better. Such contemplation involves my appreciation for the overwhelming and changing role that a teacher plays in this world.</p>
