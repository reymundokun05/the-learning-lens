		<p>Reflecting on legal foundations of education, I start to understand how profoundly they shape the role and responsibilities of a teacher. I never did before because I thought laws within education were just more as something of a backdrop, akin to rules to be followed without much personal impact. Now, I see it forms a foundation for the whole teaching profession from rights of the students and responsibilities of teachers up to the way schools may operate and decide. Knowing this has made me think differently about my role and how I can execute my teaching differently.</p>
		
		<p>The legal frameworks make me realize that every action performed within education carries an ethical as well as a legal element. In the future, as a teacher, I must consider policies that safeguard student rights regarding issues of privacy, non-discrimination, and equal access. Being responsible means knowing that part of the job would be to enforce these rights and ensure that every student has a fair chance at succeeding. Thinking back on this, I felt motivated towards vigilance in understanding these laws so that I would become a teacher who supports learning but also advocates for fairness and safety.</p>
		
		<p>One of the aspects that resonate powerfully with me is that these laws burden the responsibility of teachers to actually teach with responsibility. In student safety requirements, the reporting mandates, and the expected practice by one and all, some boundaries are set by which we, as teachers, will have to toe the line. Part of me keeps thinking that the success of our students, as well as welfare, depends partly on our hands. Contemplating this, I begin to realize it is not about the end but doing all this with rules in place such that they reflect deep caring towards the students and understand how much people are entrusting them. The law foundations of education also remind me that a classroom is never in isolation; it is interconnected with the larger community and society. In other words, the laws of education are reflective of the general value orientation of society–such as inclusiveness, equity, and safety–and remind me that teaching is also about working for the community. It makes me feel as though being a teacher is not just about imparting lessons; it's part of something bigger, and I make my way to shape the world through my students.</p>
		<p>This can also make me more aware of the challenges they present, so I think that while legal responsibilities can provide structure and constraint, too much restriction may be felt at some point, especially if it would limit flexibility in addressing unique needs of students. Reflecting on all these, I know I have to develop more skills in working within the confinements of these frameworks but at the same time as compassionate as possible and responsive to each student.</p>
