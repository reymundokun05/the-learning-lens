		<p>Taking part in a classroom debate that involved laws related to teaching career namely RA 9262, RA 10533, RA 10931 and RA 11650, helped me to realize one’s expertise in how laws influence the teaching fraternity. Each law concerns particular aspects of the teaching profession, and all of them emphasize the significance of the favorable legal conditions. The legal capacity of RA 9262: Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 emphasizes the Duty Bearers of educators to protect learner’s rights including those who are experiencing or facing domestic violence. Teachers are the front line in many cases where incipient signs of possible risky behaviours can be noticed in a student. RA 10533 also known as the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 is radical in nature which proposes the K to 12 curriculum aimed at enhancing education quality and making the Filipino graduates globally relevant. Even as we argued why for and against the idea I came to appreciate the challenges that come with making structural level changes without compromising on issues of diversity and equality.</p>
		<p>RA 10931, also known as the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act was subtheme that was promising to discuss in relation to access to higher education. The Department of Education under this law allows free tuition in state universities and colleges for deserving students who cannot afford to go to school. Its relevance towards the teaching profession is in its preparedness in churning out qualified graduates that will form the Teachocracy of the future. Lastly, RA 11650 for learners with disability for inclusive education brought out the issue that require one kind of teacher training for such purposes. Thus, it focuses on the facets of the moving of barriers and guaranteeing every learner the best education.</p>
		<p>Thinking over this debate, I learned how close education and legislation are related in constructing society. For teachers such laws need not only to be known, but also applied and followed in their everyday classroom practice. This cemented my value for teaching profession especially with regard to social justice and equality in class.</p>
