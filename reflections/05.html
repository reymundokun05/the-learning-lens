	    <p>Today was another fun day in PROFED 2 as I got to experience presenting in front of the class. I was a bit sad and very tired as I have arrived late despite rushing because I have waited for the printouts of class officers and cleaners to finish going through the lamination process. However, it seems like I have made it just right on time because the quiz is about to start in a few moments.</p>
		<p>After the quiz, I got a grade of 7 out of 10. It is low, but I know that there will be a room for improvement for me. We were tasked to present our magazines about our interview sessions with a basic education teacher after the said quiz. I was having fun listening to other groups’ stories that they are sharing on the interview they conducted, and it did not take long and it was finally our turn to present.</p>
		<p>While I was presenting, I did try my best to do a lot of explanation in fluent English, as per the professor’s rules. In addition, I tried to recall all the information that the interviewee had said. I nailed it, however, he had noted the mistakes in our magazine, most notably the editing mistakes in the heading section of the magazine. I and my groupmates had took note of these, and will try to do better and improve in the future.</p>
