	    <p>The <b>TED Talk</b> of the late <b>Rita Pierson</b>, entitled <i>"Every Kid Needs a Champion,"</i> has made a lot of impact to me. As I listen to her speech, it hit me right away that teaching in reality is not giving knowledge but about the connection we establish with our students. In fact, her speech really taught me that it is the most influential teachers who take that extra moment to envision each child beyond being a learner, but a human being with struggles and strengths, with potential yet to be realized.</p>
		<p>What really struck me was her emphasis on building relationships. I have learned that students learn when they value, and are heard. It brought a lot of reflection from me about my own experience. My mind instantly went to all those teachers who changed my life-not with lesson plans but because they took the effort to get to know me as a person. It has just evoked thoughts of how much those relationships indeed developed my confidence and motivation.</p>
		<p>That also reminded me of her address with regard to the concept of "champions" in our lives: people who believe in us when we don't. Pierson insisted that it is so important to have teachers who do not limit their role to teaching lessons but, rather, make efforts to reach out and connect with their students on a personal level, away from the strict ideas about education. I remember just thinking to myself, "The best teachers that ever were good to teach their subject matters made me feel capable and encouraged me to believe in myself.</p>
