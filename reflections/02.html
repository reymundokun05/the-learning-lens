	    <p>A lot of things has happened during the last session in PROFED 2, and I have truly learned a lot during the professor’s lecture.</p>
		<p>The last session, which was on Thursday, was the first time we meet our professor face-to-face, because of the continuous class suspensions during the last week before, due to inclement weather. During the lecture session, I was able to know and learn about the challenges in teaching, which is I think a good thing for me to know since I need to be aware that I will be facing these challenges when I am already on my chosen career path.</p>
		<p>In the middle of discussion, the professor asked about what a teacher has made positive effects on the students. I raised my hand, and was willing to answer. However, my emotions already burst even when I haven’t started sharing the story yet. This is because I remembered a late teacher of mine that has taught me a life lesson, that is, there is nothing wrong in trying something. She had taught me that I can be a leader and believed in me, even if I kept disagreeing, and saying that I cannot. I shared to the class that she really made an impact to me, although I haven’t said a lot of words due to the emotions.</p>
		<p>As the discussion continued, more students shared their stories, and I was able to reflect on my own experiences. I realized that teaching is not just about the imparting of knowledge but also, and more importantly, how it creates a living impact on the lives of students. As I started writing down notes for future study, I was much more aware of the difficulties that teachers often face, and I felt all the more responsibility that I would have to embark upon. The session made me prepared in a group work that was assigned by the instructor, and I'm eager to implement all that I've learnt as I take further steps.</p>
