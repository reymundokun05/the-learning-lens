		<p>Having read all the laws and amendments about the professionalization of teaching in the country I found out that Presidential Decree No. 1006, Republic Act No. 7836 and its amended copy Republic Act No. 9293 are important. These legislative activities have undergone the teaching profession to the professionalized cadre, creating and endorsing the standards of the teaching profession.</p>
		<p>Among them, Presidential Decree No. 1006, effective since 1977, may be regarded as the first historical step done at recognizing teaching as a profession. It created the National Board for Teachers, it set professional standards and granted license to teachers. Although this decree also reasserted the importance of teachers in nation building and sought to improve the quality in education by professionalizing the teaching force.</p>
		<p>On this grund, Republic Act No. 7836 known as the Philippine Teachers Professionalization Act of 1994 enhanced the regulation as well as supervision of teaching practice. It provided for the Professional Board for teachers that only when pass the licensure examination is given the permission to become a teacher. This brought out requirements for teachers and the code of ethical conduct for the persons practicing this noble profession to enhance their honor. </p>
		<p>In 2004, Republic Act No.9293 was passed to amend some provisions of the previous RA 7836 because of the growing needs at the educational front. It also given provisions for the granting of special permit to para-teachers and gave the teachers the right to register without examination under certain conditions. The amendments specified that the law is aware of the dynamic environment of education and makes sure that the teaching occupation is adequately and successfully diverse.</p>
		<p>I have learned a lot about these legislative achievements and their effect towards the improved education system of the Philippines. Due to the fact that the standard is high and professional development ongoing, these laws ensure that the educators are not only informed, but passionate about their profession. This realization enhances my esteem towards the teaching profession and make me appreciate whatever knowledge that I am imparted with along the professional lines as offered by knowledgeable professionals.</p>
