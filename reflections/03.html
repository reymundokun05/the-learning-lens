	    <p>Today was another day of learning. For today, we did an activity which is related to the Historical Foundations of Education. This is a group work, so I did try my best to do what I can do for the group.</p>
		<p>For the task, I provided printouts of pictures that are needed for the collage. My groupmates and I had searched for possible pictures related to our assigned topic for the task, which was the educational during the post-colonial period, and I had volunteered to print them out. In addition, I provided them manila papers, which is an important material needed for the task.</p>
		<p>During our session in PROFED 2, we were given enough time to begin the collage. It took some time to finish, but it was done after time was up. When all manila papers were posted on walls, I then took notes about all the knowledge other groups was sharing, from the education in ancient times, up to the present.</p>
		<p>On reflection of the activity, I came to the conclusion that education has had over several periods-from ancient civilizations, through old and new time-is perhaps best seen in how it reflects the values, needs, and goals of a society. It saves the old knowledge and traditions and nowadays comes to be used as a means for development and improvement. Change, therefore is thought to occur; it's pretty close to the changes that education experiences over time to suit the needs of a given generation. This also assists in bringing into light the role that is played by education in refining the civilization and impacts that follow for succeeding generations with time.</p>
